How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my code is functional by including rigourous amounts of testing. This will create a longlasting habitual standard in my life that will help make these processes easier for me and potential colleges.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

The way I interpret user needs and incorporate them into my program not only includes asking follow up questions but also quality questions that give me a clear path of understanding. User needs may be perceived differently in the eyes of the programmer due to the
different logical understandings of programs and software. Being able to understand what a user wants and creating a program that follows their vision will take time and patience.


How do I approach designing software?

My approach to designing software is extremely simple "test more than you code". By testing numerous times throughout the coding process it becomes easier to manage later on in the development lifecycle. Testing is also a perfect way to find bugs in code.
